# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge

Challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## What I did
- Made the UI responsive for 4 widths, 375px, 765px, 1024px and 1440px
- Implemented color change on transition whenever user hovered over the button

## What I learnt
- Can change the displays of elements based on media queries.
- Media-queries for different resolutions can clash


## What can be improved
- Need to learn how to avoid clashes of media-queries
- The transition from mobile to desktop versions feel a bit too jarring still
